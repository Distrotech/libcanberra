Overview

   libcanberra is an implementation of the [33]XDG Sound Theme and Name
   Specifications, for generating event sounds on free desktops, such as
   [34]GNOME. It comes with several backends ([35]ALSA, [36]PulseAudio,
   OSS, [37]GStreamer, null) and is designed to be portable. It consists
   of the following parts:
    1. libcanberra: the main library
    2. libcanberra-gtk: some glue code to make it easier to use
       libcanberra from Gtk+ applications
    3. libcanberra-gtk-module: a Gtk+ module that uses libcanberra-gtk to
       trigger input feedback event sounds

   For more information see [38]the original announcement.

Current Status

   libcanberra is mostly feature complete. For now however it includes
   backends only for ALSA, PulseAudio, OSS and GStreamer.

   libcanberra has been declared [39]a blessed GNOME dependency.

   The OSS driver is incomplete: only sound files that are in a format
   natively understood by the sound card are supported. If the sample
   type, channel map or sampling rate of the sound file are not supported
   by the sound card no automatic conversion will take place and the file
   will not be played. Also note that the OSS backend is most likely
   incompatible with OSS4, due to subtle incompatibilities between OSS4
   and the OSS 3.x.

   It is recommended to always take the "shortest" path from libcanberra
   to the audio device. I.e. don't use the GStreamer plugin if libcanberra
   supports the final output target natively. Besides being more
   resource-friendly and less error-prone, some advanced functionality
   might get lost with each layer you add to your stack. For example:
   while you could use libcanberra's Gstreamer backend to output to a
   PulseAudio server this will not be able to make use of sample cacheing
   or will be able to attach additional meta data to the sounds played,
   which might be necessary for effects like positional event sounds.

Documentation

   You may browse the [40]gtkdoc generated [41]programing documentation of
   the API.

Requirements

   Currently, libcanberra is tested on Linux only.

   libcanberra was developed and tested on Fedora Rawhide from August
   2008, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and maybe Unix
   versions) since it uses GNU autoconf and GNU libtool for source code
   configuration and shared library management.

   libcanberra has no dependencies besides the OGG Vorbis development
   headers and whatever the selected backends require. Gtk+ support is
   optional. An optional lookup cache can be used if Samba's tdb trivial
   database is available.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of libcanberra.

Acknowledgements

   Marc-André Lureau and Brian Cameron for the GStreamer backend.

   Joe Marcus Clarke for the OSS backend.

   Diego Elio Pettenò for various build system fixes.
